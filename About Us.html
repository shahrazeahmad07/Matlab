                This is the last time,
                you wish you could be a Matlab Programmer.
                This course teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous experience.
                It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn and
                versatile.
                MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs.
                The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines<br><br>
                The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple.
                As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences,
                through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry.<br>
                Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.Nevertheless, this
                course is not a MATLAB
                tutorial.
                It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer
                science and programming.
                Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer
                science,
                gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use
                of MATLAB.Requirements
                In this course we start from the very begining and no prior programming experience is required.<br>

                Matlab Programming is one of the most important technical programming languages and skills today.
                In this course, we will start learning Matlab from beginner level,
                and slowly ease our way into more advanced topics and programs.<br><br>
                This course is a general Matlab Programming training, and it means that regardless of your major and
                field of study;
                you can benefit from this course, so much so that Google's former
                svp/product management Jonathan Rosenberg recognized it as the only skill you need on your resume to be
                able to work at Google.<br><br>
                Matlab Programming is an easy and understandable programming language and is an excellent choice
                for those who want to learn programming for the first time.
                Engineering companies often use Matlab to prototype and validate their ideas before
                committing to build it with other programs like Java, Python, C, and C++.
                Knowing Matlab will give you the competitive advantage in your career.
                This course is being updated continuously and new materials are added to library every week.<br><br>
